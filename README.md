**Simple Model of Estimated Occupational Resilence**

The analysis began by integrating new 2024–2034 BLS Employment Projections to update critical wage and employment data, prioritizing these figures over legacy sources and resolving merging conflicts through standardized cleaning. Following data integration, the study performed feature engineering to construct a "Demand_Index" based on projected growth and isolated 17 distinct skill categories as independent variables, explicitly excluding direct automation proxies to prevent data leakage. Four machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network—were then trained to predict "High Risk" occupations based solely on these skill and demand profiles. The process concluded by evaluating model performance with metrics like AUC, interpreting feature importance through coefficients and decision rules, and generating storytelling visualizations such as the "Rank Mobility Slopegraph" to illustrate how economic demand buffers against technological risk.

A summary of the findings reveals that skill profiles and market trends are highly effective predictors of automation risk, with the Logistic Regression model achieving the highest accuracy (AUC of 0.876) by isolating these factors. Statistical interpretation identified human-centric attributes—specifically physical strength, creativity, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills—as significant "protective" factors that lower displacement probability, whereas administrative components associated with reading, writing, and leadership tended to increase risk. Crucially, the "Demand_Index" emerged as a powerful moderator; strong projected employment growth effectively "buffered" technologically exposed occupations, shifting them into safer risk rankings. Additionally, the analysis highlighted that Master’s and Doctoral degree paths offer the highest resilience and wage attractiveness, a finding mirrored in the strong performance of Saint Leo University’s "Management" and "Sports Business" programs, which align with the complex, non-routine skills least susceptible to automation.

In conclusion, the analysis demonstrates that occupational security is defined not merely by technological feasibility but by the dynamic interplay between complex human skills and structural labor market demand. It underscores a distinct advantage for higher educational attainment, particularly in fields that foster non-routine, creative, and interpersonal abilities which remain difficult for algorithms to replicate. Ultimately, the findings prove that strong market demand can shield technologically exposed jobs from displacement, providing a robust, data-driven framework for students and educators to make strategic decisions that align personal interests with enduring career resilience.
