        "This notebook investigates automation risk by analyzing skills required for work and labor market demand, distinguishing technological feasibility from economic demand. It uses data from O*NET, BLS Employment Projections for skill quantification and structural demand, and legacy automation measures for labeling and visuals only. The notebook constructs new metrics like 'Demand_Index' and a binary 'High_Risk' label for supervised learning. The modeling strategy focuses strictly on skills and demand as predictors, explicitly excluding direct automation proxies to avoid data leakage. The entire process emphasizes federal/statistical sources for data and methods, ensuring reproducibility and acknowledging the inherent limitations of projections versus predictions."

Perform feature engineering, including creating the 'Demand_Index' and identifying 17 skill columns, ensuring numerical consistency and handling missing values. Redefine the 'High_Risk' target variable as the top quartile of 'Likelihood_of_Automation_Consensus' from the updated data. Retrain and evaluate all machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network) using the new dataset, generating Plotly confusion matrices and ROC curves. Interpret model features by displaying detailed Logistic Regression results using statsmodels, and plotting feature importances for Logistic Regression, Random Forest (Gini and Permutation), and Decision Tree using interactive Plotly bar charts, along with presenting textual Decision Tree rules. Regenerate storytelling visualizations, including the 'Automation Risk Quadrant Scatter' (using predicted high risk probability vs. consensus risk and demand) and the 'Rank Mobility Slopegraph' (comparing tech-only rank vs. demand-adjusted rank). Recalculate and visualize the attractiveness and resilience metrics for different educational paths by grouping occupations by 'Typical education needed for entry' and presenting interactive scatter plots of average wages vs. adjusted automation risk, colored by demand and predicted high-risk proportion. Identify and summarize the top occupations within each educational category that are most attractive and resilient to automation, including insights on attractive and resilient degree paths. Finally, provide a comprehensive summary of the analysis, highlighting key findings, model performance, and data visualization with the new employment projections data."

            "- Master's degree:\n",

            "--- General Observations from Visualizations ---\n",
            "1. High-wage, high-demand, and low-risk paths (top-left quadrant in the scatter plots) typically include educational requirements like 'Doctoral or professional degree' and 'Master's degree'. These paths often involve complex cognitive skills less susceptible to current automation technologies, coupled with strong market demand.\n",
            "2. Educational paths requiring 'Less than high school' or 'High school diploma or equivalent' tend to cluster in the lower-right quadrant, indicating lower average wages and higher adjusted automation risk. These roles often involve more routine tasks that are more easily automatable.\n",
            "3. 'Associate's degree' and 'Bachelor's degree' categories show a wider spread, with some occupations within these categories demonstrating better resilience and attractiveness than others, suggesting variability within these broader educational paths.\n",
            "4. The `Demand_Index` (color in the first plot) clearly shows its moderating effect. Educational paths with higher demand (brighter color) tend to have lower adjusted risk for a given original risk level, moving them towards the left on the X-axis or contributing to higher wages.\n",
            "5. The `Proportion_High_Risk_RF` (color in the second plot) provides a model-driven perspective on predicted risk. While 'Average Adjusted Automation Risk' is a continuous measure, `Proportion_High_Risk_RF` highlights the binary outcome of the Random Forest model, reinforcing which educational paths have a higher concentration of predicted high-risk occupations.\n",
            "\n",
            "--- Trade-offs and Interesting Patterns ---\n",
            "1. There's a general positive correlation between educational attainment and average median annual wage, and a negative correlation with automation risk. Higher education often leads to roles requiring advanced skills that are harder to automate.\n",
            "2. Some paths, despite having a moderate 'Average Adjusted Automation Risk', might show very high 'Total Employment' (large bubbles), indicating a significant portion of the workforce is in these areas. Understanding the specific occupations within these large bubbles is crucial for targeted policy or career guidance.\n",
            "3. The scatter plots allow for identifying outliers or unexpected clusters, where an educational path might perform better or worse than its peers in terms of attractiveness or resilience, prompting further investigation into the specific occupations within those categories.\n"

        "\n",
        "**2. Top Performing Programs (Based on Weighted Composite Score):**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Management:** Consistently ranked highest, Management offers excellent wage potential, strong overall demand, and a broad range of occupations. Its relatively low adjusted automation risk underscores the resilience of roles requiring management and leadership skills.\n",
        "*   **Sports Business:** Despite a lower average wage, this program stands out with a very high demand index and the lowest adjusted automation risk. This points to a highly resilient and in-demand niche, likely due to the human-centric and dynamic nature of sports-related roles.\n",
        "*   **Economics:** Demonstrates strong average wages and an exceptionally high demand index. Its analytical focus, particularly in areas like data science, positions it well against automation.\n",
        "*   **Business Administration:** A versatile program with solid average wages and good resilience. Its foundational business skills are broadly applicable across various managerial and analytical roles with relatively low adjusted automation risk.\n",
        "*   **Finance:** With high average wages and strong demand, Finance remains an attractive field. While some roles within finance may have automation potential, the program's overall profile, enhanced by broader keyword mapping, shows good resilience.\n",
        "*   **Communication:** Offers solid wages and good resilience, as human-centric skills like public relations, writing, and social media management are less susceptible to full automation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Overall Trends and Insights:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Resilience of Human-Centric Skills:** Occupations requiring strong interpersonal, creative, critical thinking, and physical skills consistently show lower automation risk. These are often emphasized in higher education programs.\n",
        "*   **Importance of Market Demand:** The `Demand_Index` plays a crucial moderating role. Even occupations with some technological automation risk can be buffered by high market demand, moving them toward a more favorable outlook.\n",
        "*   **Higher Education Advantage:** Generally, higher educational attainment correlates with higher average median annual wages and lower automation risk, indicating that advanced skills remain valuable and less automatable.\n",
        "*   **Variability within Categories:** Within broader educational categories like 'Associate's' and 'Bachelor's' degrees, there's significant variability. This highlights the importance of analyzing specific occupations within these paths to identify resilient and attractive sub-fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis provides a robust framework for evaluating Saint Leo University's Bachelor's degree programs against evolving labor market dynamics.

        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Data Integration and Prioritization**: New employment projections data from \"Employment Projections.csv\" was successfully loaded and prioritized, updating the main dataset `df`.\n",
        "*   **Feature Engineering**: A `Demand_Index` was created based on employment change percentiles. The target variable `High_Risk` was defined as the top quartile of `Likelihood_of_Automation_Consensus`.\n",
        "*   **Model Performance**: A Logistic Regression model achieved the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.876 among the trained models for predicting high automation risk.\n",
        "*   **Key Predictors of Automation Risk**:\n",
        "    *   **Negative Predictors (Reducing Risk)**: 'Creativity and innovation', 'Critical and analytical thinking', 'Physical strength and stamina', 'Speaking and listening', and 'Demand_Index' were identified as significant factors reducing the likelihood of automation risk.\n",
        "    *   **Consistent Importance**: Across various models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree), 'Physical strength and stamina', 'Creativity and innovation', 'Critical and analytical thinking', and 'Demand_Index' consistently emerged as highly influential features.\n",
        "*   **Impact of Demand on Risk Perception**: Visualizations demonstrated that incorporating `Demand_Index` significantly shifts the perceived automation risk rank for many occupations, highlighting its moderating effect.\n",
        "*   **Educational Attainment and Outlook**: Higher educational attainment (e.g., Doctoral, Master's degrees) generally correlates with higher average median annual wages and lower adjusted automation risk. The \"Master's degree\" category was identified as the most attractive and resilient educational path quantitatively.\n",
        "*   **Composite Attractiveness and Resilience Score**: A new composite score was calculated, weighting 'Employment, 2023' (30%), 'Median Annual Wage' (30%), and equally distributing the remaining 40% among 'Demand_Index', 'Adjusted_Risk', and 'Predicted High Risk' (from the Random Forest model).\n",
